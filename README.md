Part 0: TCGA,cBIoportal,GEPIA2 application  

## Coding practices  
Part I: LINUX pactices & simple project.  
Part II: RNA-seq analysis pipeline  
Pert III: R + Differential expression analysis basic plots

NOTICES: Part 0 I II III are independent modules, no need to do in turn or complete all practices.
